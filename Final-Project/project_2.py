Method used for oddments:
1. Subtract the 2 digits in the first column and write the difference
under the second column ignoring the sign.
2. Subtract the 2 digits in the second column and write the difference
under the first column ignoring the sign.
3. repeat the first 2 steps for the rows.
4. calculate the oddments to determine the best strategy for each player.


                    Cost Matrix for game:

                        Player B
                    ____a_______b____           _________________
           Choice a |  a,a  |  a,b  |           |   2   |   5   |
Player A            |-------|-------|   -->     |-------|-------|
           Choice b |  b,a  |  b,b  |           |   3   |  -3   |
                    |-------|-------|           |-------|-------|


Oddments    |   b,a - b,b   |   a,b - a,a   |   a,b - b,b   |   b,a - a,a   |
            |               |               |               |               |
            | 3 - (-3) = 6  |   5 - 2 = 3   | 5 - (-3) = 8  |   3 - 2 = 1   |
            |               |               |               |               |
            |   P_A a = 6   |   P_A b = 3   |   P_B a = 8   |   P_B b = 1   |

    The value of the row and column oddments should add up to the same
    value. Taking the rows and the columns: 
            6 + 3 == 8 + 1
    
    Probability of Player A using oddment a ->  6 / (6 + 3) = 2/3
    Probability of Player A using oddment b ->  3 / (6 + 3) = 1/3
    Probability of Player B using oddment a ->  8 / (8 + 1) = 8/9
    Probability of Player B using oddment b ->  1 / (8 + 1) = 1/9

    Value of the game:
    Take the first row, multiply a and b by their respective column oddments.
    Then divide the value by the total of oddments
    ((2 * 8) + (5 * 1)) / 9  = 7/3

    So in conclusion, Player A should go with choice a and Player B
    should go with choice a, as well.

    Player A has the best results in row c, since there are 2 positives and only 1
    negative. So it is in Player A's best interest to get player B to choose anything
    but c, preferably a.
    
    On the other hand, Player B has the best results in column a, able to get a 2 or
    1, with a chance of getting -2. It is in Player B's best interest to get Player A
    to choose anything but c, preferably a.

    Option 1:

    Player B states that they will choose option 'a' not matter what. They have the 
    best odds of getting a positive score in that column, after all.

    Player A threatens that if Player B doesn't change their choice , they
    will always choose 'c'.

    This is a threat because this action would be harmful to Player B. 

    After making this threat, the available outcomes are as follows:

              a           b           c
        _____________________________________
    a   |   -2,2    |     X     |     X     |
        |-----------|-----------|-----------|  
    b   |   -1,1    |     X     |     X     |
        |-----------|-----------|-----------|
    c   |   2,-2    |     X     |     X     |
        |-----------|-----------|-----------|
    
    Player A can either commit to their threat and force the outcome to be (2, -1) or
    they can choose 'a' or 'b'. They would never want to do this however unless they 
    thought player B was lying.

    Option 2:

    Player B promises Player A that if they don't choose option 'c', they won't choose
    option 'c' either. This is a promise because player A doesn't want player B to 
    choose option 'c' ideally, and player B just saved player A from getting a double
    'c' outcome, resulting in a -2 for them.

    Player A can either keep the promise that was made or choose option 'c' anyway. They
    would never want to choose 'b', since there is no positive outcome for them if
    player B stays true to their promise, so they will either choose 'a' or 'c' anyway.

    After making this promise, the available outcomes are as follows:

              a           b           c
        _____________________________________
